				<h2> Lists and Links
					<p> 
						In this project, we are creating a new folder and are making index and css files inside that folder and uploading them to the production server and github. This means that we will have multiple folders.
					</p>
				<ul>Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.</ul>
				<ul>Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"</ul>
				<ul>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.</ul>
				<ul>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.<ul>
				<ul>In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.</ul>
				<ul>In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".</ul>
				<ul>Add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements.</ul>
			<ul>Turn in your work.</ul>
